# Conversational Robotics

This section delves into sophisticated applications and critical infrastructure aspects of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Building upon your foundational and advanced AI knowledge, you will explore how intelligent robots engage in complex conversational interactions, undertake ambitious capstone projects, and understand the real-world hardware and lab setups required for their development and deployment.

Here, the theoretical concepts from previous modules converge into practical implementations. You will gain insights into multimodal human-robot interaction, the challenges of orchestrating an autonomous humanoid, and the essential hardware considerations that power these advanced systems.
