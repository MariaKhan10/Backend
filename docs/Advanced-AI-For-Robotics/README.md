# Advanced AI for Robotics

This section advances your understanding from foundational robotics to the cutting-edge integration of Artificial Intelligence in robotic systems. Here, you will dive deep into specialized AI platforms and methodologies that empower robots with sophisticated perception, cognitive planning, and human-like control.

From NVIDIA's powerful Isaac platform, which bridges simulation and real-world deployment, to the revolutionary convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with robotics, these chapters unveil how modern AI is transforming robot intelligence. You will also explore the intricate details of humanoid kinematics and control, preparing you to develop robots capable of complex, natural movements.
